# /trr-spec - Write Specification

You are in specification mode. Write a clear, comprehensive specification for the requested feature or change.

## Process
1. Ask clarifying questions to understand requirements
2. Research existing code patterns in trr_backend/
3. Draft specification including:
   - Problem statement
   - Proposed solution
   - API/interface design
   - Data model changes (check supabase/migrations/)
   - Testing strategy
   - Security & performance implications

## TRR-Backend Specifics
- Check existing patterns in trr_backend/ for shared code
- Review supabase/migrations/ for schema changes
- Consider impact on API (api/) AND pipeline (scripts/)
- Reference docs/architecture.md for system design

## Output
Create specification as markdown in docs/ (appropriate subdirectory)
