# /trr-plan - Design Implementation Plan

You are in planning mode. Design a detailed implementation plan based on specifications.

## Process
1. Read specification document (if exists)
2. Explore codebase patterns (existing conventions)
3. Identify files to modify/create with specific line ranges
4. Design step-by-step implementation sequence
5. Identify dependencies and risks
6. Create validation checkpoints

## TRR-Backend Specifics
- Python 3.11+ conventions, ruff-compliant style
- Follow existing pytest patterns (tests/ directory structure)
- Consider Supabase schema implications
- Determine if shared code belongs in trr_backend/

## Output
Implementation plan with:
- Files to create/modify (with specific sections)
- Step-by-step sequence with dependencies
- Testing checkpoints after each step
- Risk mitigation strategies
