# Instagram ingestion rebuild

## Authority and scope

The user approved implementation in the current Codex conversation on 2026-10-16.
The earlier plan-only sentence in the copied plan describes the planning turn;
the subsequent explicit implementation request authorizes this work. Preserve
existing branches and unrelated changes. No new paid services are authorized.

Instagram first: listing, details, comments/replies and hosted media. Keep current
authentication, source scopes, date semantics, selected tasks, lane pressure,
identity blocks, retry budgets and completion rules. Keep existing run identities
and canonical data. Other platforms and active legacy runs stay on their owner.

## Accepted design

- Explicit domain/application/workflows/providers/persistence/queries modules.
- No social monolith, runtime namespace publication or wildcard imports in the new path.
- Compare real DBOS and Temporal locally before choosing. Engine history schedules;
  Postgres business receipts establish completion. No implicit engine migration.
- Transactional run intent/outbox, deterministic execution identities, fenced
  remote reservations and idempotent canonical writes.
- Freeze launch policy; persist listing discovery; seal downstream manifests when
  discovery completes. Unknown totals are not complete.
- Detail accounting: total = committed + cached_satisfied + source_unavailable +
  unresolved. Requests/attempts are separate. Preserve three-attempt detail cap.
- Fetch, sanitize/retain, normalize, validate, commit and receipt. Private Postgres
  evidence retained 30 days; unresolved runs pin needed payloads. Keep provenance.
  Replay defaults to dry-run and cannot replace newer observations with old data.
- Strict v2 actions and read-only progress, generated openapi-typescript /
  openapi-fetch / openapi-react-query clients, TanStack Query ingestion panels.
- Existing caller compatibility, additive schema and disabled initial rollout.

## Gates and execution ledger

| Gate | Evidence required | Status |
|---|---|---|
| A | Current behavior matrix and sanitized fixture baselines | Legacy callable map and retained native fixtures established; unassigned media and avatar parity added |
| B | Matched real-engine failure harness; hosting/recovery/version feasibility | DBOS selected for implementation after local comparison, bounded-executor and 50-target partition tests; production topology verification remains a release gate |
| C | Domain/provider/replay parity and import boundaries | Canonical, listing, comments, media, runtime integration and hosted-result replay extension implemented and reviewed; local checks pass |
| D | Real persistence crash, ownership, cancellation and recovery tests | Real PostgreSQL and DBOS failure tests pass; connected four-stage lost-acknowledgement/cancel/resume pipeline passes; live recovery remains pending |
| E | Backend schema/client parity and browser operator flow | API, generated client, UI checks and approved full production build pass; live browser acceptance blocked by shared-router restoration |
| F | Deployment identity/readiness, bounded canary, 10 runs and 24h observation | Pending |

Engine selection: DBOS 3.3.0 is the implementation candidate. Real local engine
comparison, version-aware recovery, bounded single-executor replacement and
50-target partition continuation evidence support this selection. Independent
review found and closed a cancellation-at-continuation defect and clarified
statement-counter exclusions. Temporal's local correctness evidence does not
provide an existing authorized production Temporal service. No new service is
provisioned. Separate bounded/partition probes do not establish aggregate
production connection limits. Modal lifecycle, session-preserving Supabase
connections, restricted role grants and resource acceptance remain mandatory
before deployment/canary acceptance.

Candidates must pass recovery before/after dispatch and commit,
duplicate/stale owner, durable cooldown/cancel/resume, version pinning and bounded
history/resource checks. Prefer existing authorized hosting, then fewer services,
then measured coordination/recovery overhead, then DBOS. Neither qualifying means
hold engine adoption and continue independent modules/contracts, not fake success.

Runtime target record: Modal admin-56995 / trr-backend-jobs / main; Supabase
vwxfvzutyufrkhfgoeaa. Reverify before mutation and resolve recorded checkpoints.
Preserve current hard capacity caps. Reject unexplained >10% regressions in matched
DB sessions, coordination queries per committed target or ingestion elapsed time.
Full app build requires explicit current-chat approval after quick validation.
Browser acceptance uses dev-hybrid, TRR profile and canonical Portless URLs.

Canary selected by the user on 2026-10-16: Instagram `bravotv`, all calendar
2026. Freeze the UTC interval `[2026-01-01T00:00:00Z, 2027-01-01T00:00:00Z)`.
Run one at a time after release prerequisites pass. This selection does not
bypass parity, build, security, deployment, resource or observation gates.

Rollback disables new routing; pinned runs drain/pause on compatible workers. No
destructive schema rollback, in-flight engine transfers or duplicate live shadows.

## Ownership and starting state

- Parent: integration, domain contracts, persistence and rollout acceptance.
- Engine evaluation helper: scripts/ingestion_engine_eval,
  tests/ingestion_engine_eval, docs/architecture/ingestion-engine-evaluation.md.
- Baseline helper: read-only callable/behavior map.
- Backend starts at 59ccb5f4fcd63ca804aca7deea3958c4cc3c9816 on
  chore/repo-hygiene-2026-09-25 with unrelated dirty docs/tests.
- App starts at d11cd2813df09cf05e0c4712a5c5aae31826f780 on that same branch
  name with unrelated dirty docs and three components/pages.
- Hindsight initiative capture returned HTTP 402, balance zero. No memory write
  succeeded; this document is the execution record.

## Validation discipline

Use focused existing pytest/Vitest/Playwright checks, retaining passing evidence
on unchanged inputs. Test repeat submit/resume, read-only GET, worker death at all
side-effect boundaries, stale ownership, 429/auth/database pressure, unavailable
source evidence, partial comments/media, replay expiry and timestamp preservation,
refresh/multi-tab/network loss and UI actions. Independently review the complete
failure harness and rollout batch before production acceptance.

## Local evidence, 2026-10-16

- Engine report: `ingestion-engine-evaluation.md`; real DBOS/Temporal matrix,
  native Temporal pinning, 1000-target finite workload, partial cancellation,
  DBOS bounded executor replacement and explicit engine cancelled-state checks.
  None is live Modal/Supabase acceptance or a current-ingestion performance baseline.
- Foundation: 9 domain/evidence tests; 10 isolated PostgreSQL persistence cases;
  3 strict contract/read-only query cases. Use `--confcutdir=tests/ingestion` to
  isolate them from production fixture initialization. No live requests.
- Independent review found four defects, all repaired and confirmed in a fixes-only
  follow-up: discovery page replay/cursor ordering, UTC elapsed retention,
  evidence-to-target provenance and exact UTF-8 payload-size limits.
- Queries/schema work added after that review is not covered by its acceptance.
- The additive migrations are tested only on private PostgreSQL and are not applied
  remotely. API and Modal entry points now bind the feature behind explicit flags;
  launch is additionally limited to the configured account, date window and run budget.
- Explicit workflow state commands now cover retry checkpoint/cooldown retention,
  exhausted-attempt blocking, all-stage completion and outbox crash redelivery.
  Fourteen persistence/workflow cases pass against isolated PostgreSQL.
- Offline replay tests verify original capture times, account scoping, no source
  requests or writes, explicit unavailable-parser behavior and sanitized rich
  GraphQL/comment-media fields. Twelve replay/domain cases pass.
- Post activity tests prove evidence retention before validation, no database lock
  held during fetch, unresolved partial source and capture-time binding at receipt.
  Fourteen affected application/persistence cases pass.
- Canonical post/comment extraction used disjoint helper ownership; integration
  and release acceptance remain with the parent.

## Integration evidence and remaining release work

- The user approved the full app production build in this chat. It passed once;
  unchanged build inputs have not been rebuilt. Generated contracts, focused UI
  checks and direct-SQL inventory verification passed. The app adds HTTP calls,
  not direct SQL, so no SQL exception or migration-ledger entry is required.
- The connected local PostgreSQL test uses two classified posts, two listing
  pages and four native comment pages. It proves eight business receipts, twelve
  evidence records, four comment-page receipts, sealed completion in all four
  stages, lost-ack recovery without refetch and cancel/resume into generation 3.
  Source HTTP and object storage are controlled fixtures; this is not live proof.
- Independent fixes-only review closed all eight findings from the core and
  provider batches. The final integration batch found two additional defects:
  stale cached avatars could ignore newer registry observations, and the finite
  coordinator delayed legacy recovery. Both are fixed and confirmed by a
  fixes-only review. Seven affected media checks and six new plus five existing
  sweep checks passed; unchanged checks were reused.
- Existing physical Modal functions and their caps are retained. New admission
  counts legacy work, and the legacy budget now counts new leases and ambiguous
  sends after schema readiness. These are capacity snapshots, not a cross-system
  atomic reservation. The DBOS coordinator is protected by a session singleton.
- Narrow equal-output canonical persistence measured 633 versus 603 statements
  for 30 posts, a 4.9751% increase. Actual details-phase orchestration measured
  1,334 versus 1,184 execution statements for 12 targets, a 12.6689% increase,
  with peak database sessions of two for both. All 150 added statements are
  attributed in the engine report. The candidate refreshes the catalog as well
  as post/canonical models; that legacy details path does not. Therefore this
  broader probe proves common post/request accounting, not equal coverage in
  all three models. Timing is descriptive. Listing/comments/media and DBOS
  metadata overhead remain outside this matched phase measurement.
- Replay supports detail, comment, listing and hosted-media application with
  original-time and newer-observation guards. Successful media work retains
  both source inventory and a strict hosted-result envelope. Replay restores
  canonical metadata from those historical outputs without remote-object
  verification; it retains only hashes actually produced by the mirror. Old
  inventory-only captures remain preview-only. The bounded extension passed
  64 affected checks, two capture-boundary checks, ten domain/evidence checks,
  a timestamp round-trip check and independent review without findings.
- Default-off runtime flags, an explicit restricted-role DBOS bootstrap CLI,
  and exact target/account/window canary configuration are implemented. Live
  Supabase inspection confirmed the intended project and no ingestion or DBOS
  schema yet. No remote migration, secret change, deployment or canary has run.
- Next gates: restore the shared router and complete browser acceptance, then
  apply the additive schema and
  restricted DBOS bootstrap on the verified target, deploy disabled, verify
  readiness and the affected worker path, then enable only the approved canary.
  Ten successful runs and 24 hours of observation remain unfulfilled.

## Shared local router incident

During browser preparation, a helper invoked `portless proxy stop --help` as a
help query. Portless 0.15.6 ignored the help flag and stopped the shared managed
router. This was an agent error. THB's route registrations and application
processes remained intact. The original Project Manager manifest already uses
wildcard routing; the TRR startup guard did not recognize its managed process.
A source-only compatibility repair and tests now address that recognition.
Its 29 focused checks and fixes-only review passed. Managed ownership is checked
independently from readiness, and a restoration between checks cannot trigger a
replacement proxy. The workspace repair is committed locally as `c83903d`.

The exact restoration is:

```sh
sudo launchctl kickstart -k system/local.thomashulihan.projectmanager.portless-router
```

The non-interactive attempt was blocked by `sudo: a password is required`.
The user was asked to run this command in their own terminal, without sharing
credentials. Restoration and trusted HTTPS checks of both THB hosts are pending.
The user then authorized Computer Use to run the command. That tool explicitly
blocked Terminal access for safety, so no Terminal command ran. The exact
terminal command remains pending with the user.
The installed Project Manager's native Router Setup was also inspected. Its
Start or update router control entered Checking while reporting a listener
ownership conflict. The original PID and stale ready receipt remained, and the
proxy markers were still absent; this did not establish recovery.
No configuration, route or application-server rollback is required. No browser
acceptance is claimed while the router is unavailable.

## Local delivery

- Workspace startup compatibility: `c83903d` on `main`.
- App controls and generated contracts: `36fd62c` on
  `chore/repo-hygiene-2026-09-25`. The 19 committed paths exclude all preexisting
  dirty app work. Semantic OpenAPI review confirms nine added routes/operations
  and 18 added schemas, with no existing API contract changes.
- These are local source commits. No push, remote migration, deployment, enabled
  routing, or production canary is implied by them.
